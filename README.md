## Cube to cube command API

- `SEND msgid id message`     :       sends a message; receiving cubes that don't match id ignore it
- `SENDCMD msgid id command`  :       sends a command; receiving cubes that don't match id ignore it
- `ACK msgid`                     :       acknowledges receipt of a message (only for SEND/SENDCMD messages)
- `BDCAST msgid message`        :       broadcasts a message on all faces
- `BDCASTCMD msgid command`     :       broadcasts a command on all faces (command will be executed by all cubes that receive it)

`msgid` is formed by appending an integer count to the end of the sender's MAC address. Example: C6:EA:B8:01:3D:EE+12. The MAC addresses are hashed on each cube.

Note that in implementation, words are semicolon separated as commands can contain spaces.
