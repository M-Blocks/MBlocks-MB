This SoftDevice release has internal changes that requires that the SoftDevice
is programmed onto the chip in a specific way.  The following Nordic tools
handle this:

- nrfjprog version 5.0.1 or higher
- nRFgo Studio version 1.17.0 or higher.  

If you have these updated tools, programming can be done as usual.  If these
tools are not available, a separate programming tool will be distributed with
the release.
